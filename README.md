  <h1>Youtube Downloader</h1>
  <p>A simple WinForms app to download videos and audios for youtube</p>
</div>

> [!WARNING]
> This app is still in development and may cause unexpected bugs.

## Background
So, first semester of school is almost over, and here we're assigned to make our final project. And the thing that popup in my mind is this, Youtube Downloader.
And here it is, the Youtube Downloader I make for my final project of first semester.

This would probably still have soo much bugs and unhandled errors, but the main function to download videos and audios is working perfectly.

## Requirements
This is a WinForms app, so you need to have **.NET SDK** to be installed on your system.

There's also other dependencies that install automatically when you start the app:
- [Ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) for converting videos
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) to fetch and download content from youtube

## Download & Install
The app hasn't been released yet. But when the times come, there's should be a pre-release in the [Release](https://github.com/aryareal1/YouTubeDownloader/releases) section
